# Test fuzzing. We could assume go-fuzz and go-fuzz-build binaries are in the path,
# but we start these tests doing 'go get' on github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz/... because we need
# the go-fuzz-dep source code to be findable by go-fuzz-build (when it invokes 'go list').
# TODO: $WORK/gopath/bin is actually not in the path; installing a binary here does not mean we can use it.
# We might need to adjust the PATH in our testscript setup to include $WORK/gopath/bin,
# or provide a FZGO_PATH_SEPARATOR variable to enable us to do the same from within a testscript, or some other soln.
# For now, we rely on the binaries being in the system path. 
# Reminder: the tests here can be run by themselves from the fzgo directory via:
#    go test -run=TestScripts/fuzzing$ .

# Exit early if -short was specified.
